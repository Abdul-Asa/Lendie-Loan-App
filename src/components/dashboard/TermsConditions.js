            Fees and Charges
          </Heading>

            The service is subject to a finance charge based on the applicable
            interest rate. Lendie will always disclose the specific finance
            charge and repayment option. In the event of late payment, Lendie
            will charge you a late payment fee. The fee is fixed by Credpal and
            it may be revised from time.

            Lendie damage or loss.

            no obligation to inform you before the proceedings commence. <br />

            incurred by Lendie in attempting to obtain repayment of any
            outstanding balance owed by you.
            <br />
            4. Interest on any amount which becomes due and payable shall be
            charged.
